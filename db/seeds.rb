# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)


# Create 1 admin user with email admin@mail.com and password supersecret
# Create 4 member users
# Each member should create some tweets
# Each member should reply to some other tweets
# Each member should like some tweets
